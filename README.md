- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tserrof7
- 👀 Recently certified Data Analyst with a passionate drive to learn more about data and ways to derive information from it.  
- 🌱 Proficient in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Excel. Though I have learned much through my recent bootcamp experience, I still much more to learn. This Data Analytics Bootcamp program was my introduction into this world of data, but I have a new found passion for it.
- I have found that I very much enjoy learning about the world around me using data and building a story based off of it, and I am eager to see what more I can do with it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will teach me how to properly use these tools to advance my skills and further a career.
