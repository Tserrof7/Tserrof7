- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tserrof7
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Data Analyst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Excel. I am truly a beginner at all of this, but I have a drive to learn as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will teach me how to properly use these tools to advance my skills and further a career.
