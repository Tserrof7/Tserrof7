- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tserrof7
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Data Analyst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Excel. I am truly a beginner at all of this, but I have a drive to learn as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will teach me how to properly use these tools to advance my skills and further a career.
- 📫 How to reach me forrest.margulies@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have just recently completed my Data Analytics Certification through University of Oregon's online Data Analytics Bootcamp program! I'm very eager and excited now to further explore the world of data and see what more I can learn!
